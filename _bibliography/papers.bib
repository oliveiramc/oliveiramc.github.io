      abstract={We propose a framework for Bayesian Likelihood-Free Inference (LFI) based on Generalized Bayesian Inference using scoring rules (SR). SR are used to evaluate probabilistic models given an observation; a proper SR is minimised in expectation when the model corresponds to the true data generating process for the observation. Using a strictly proper SR, for which the above minimum is unique, ensures posterior consistency of our method. As the likelihood function is intractable for LFI, we employ consistent estimators of SR using model simulations in a pseudo-marginal MCMC; we show the target of such chain converges to the exact SR posterior with increasing number of simulations. Furthermore, we note popular LFI techniques like Bayesian Synthetic Likelihood (BSL) and semiparametric BSL can be seen as special cases of our framework using only proper (but not strictly so) SR. We provide empirical results validating our consistency result and show how related approaches do not enjoy this property. Practically, we use the Energy and Kernel Scores, but our general framework sets the stage for extensions with other scoring rules. },

  abstract={To perform Bayesian inference for stochastic simulator models for which the likelihood is not accessible, Likelihood-Free Inference (LFI) relies on simulations from the model. Standard LFI methods can be split according to how these simulations are used: to build an explicit Surrogate Likelihood, or to accept/reject parameter values according to a measure of distance from the observations (Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)). In both cases, simulations are adaptively tailored to the value of the observation. Here, we generate parameter-simulation pairs from the model independently on the observation, and use them to learn a conditional exponential family likelihood approximation; to parametrize it, we use Neural Networks whose weights are tuned with Score Matching. With our likelihood approximation, we can employ MCMC for doubly intractable distributions to draw samples from the posterior for any number of observations without additional model simulations, with performance competitive to comparable approaches. Further, the sufficient statistics of the exponential family can be used as summaries in ABC, outperforming the state-of-the-art method in five different models with known likelihood. Finally, we apply our method to a challenging model from meteorology.},

The dynamical model adjustment is performed via Approximate Bayesian Computation. Optimal lockdown and exit strategies are determined based on nonlinear model predictive control, constrained to public-health and socio-economic factors. Through an extensive computational validation of the methodology, it is shown that it is possible to compute robust exit strategies with realistic reduced mobility values to inform public policy making, and we exemplify the applicability of the methodology using datasets from England and France.},

  abstract={Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) provides us with a way to infer parameters of models, for which the likelihood function is not available, from an observation. Using ABC, which depends on many simulations from the considered model, we develop an inferential framework to learn parameters of a stochastic numerical simulator of volcanic eruption. Moreover, the model itself is parallelized using Message Passing Interface (MPI). Thus, we develop a nested-parallelized MPI communicator to handle the expensive numerical model with ABC algorithms. ABC usually relies on summary statistics of the data in order to measure the discrepancy model output and observation. However, informative summary statistics cannot be found for the considered model. We therefore develop a technique to learn a distance between model outputs based on deep metric-learning. We use this framework to learn the plume characteristics (eg. initial plume velocity) of the volcanic eruption from the tephra deposits collected by field-work associated with the 2450 BP Pululagua (Ecuador) volcanic eruption.},

abstract={Lung cancer is the most lethal malignant neoplasm worldwide, with an annual estimated rate of 1.8 million deaths. Computed tomography has been widely used to diagnose and detect lung cancer, but its diagnosis remains an intricate and challenging work, even for experienced radiologists. Computer-aided diagnosis tools and radiomics tools have provided support to the radiologist's decision, acting as a second opinion. The main focus of these tools has been to analyze the intranodular zone; nevertheless, recent works indicate that the interaction between the nodule and its surroundings (perinodular zone) could be relevant to the diagnosis process. However, only a few works have investigated the importance of specific attributes of the perinodular zone and have shown how important they are in the classification of lung nodules. In this context, the purpose of this work is to evaluate the impact of using the perinodular zone on the characterization of lung lesions. Motivated by reproducible research, we used a large public dataset of solid lung nodule images and extracted fine-tuned radiomic attributes from the perinodular and intranodular zones. Our best-evaluated model obtained an average AUC of 0.916, an accuracy of 84.26{\%}, a sensitivity of 84.45{\%}, and specificity of 83.84{\%}. The combination of attributes from the perinodular and intranodular zones in the image characterization resulted in an improvement in all the metrics analyzed when compared to intranodular-only characterization. Therefore, our results highlighted the importance of using the perinodular zone in the solid pulmonary nodules classification process.},

abstract = {Abstract Among all cancer-related deaths, lung cancer leads all indicators, accounting for approximately 20\% of all types. Patients diagnosed in the early stages have a 1-year survival rate of 81\% to 85\%, while in an advanced stage have 15\% to 19\% chances of survival. The primary manifestation of this cancer is through pulmonary nodule on computed tomography images. In the early stages, it is a complex task even for experienced specialists and presents some challenges to classify these nodules in benign or malignant. So, to assist specialists, computer-aided diagnosis systems have been used to improve the accuracy in the diagnosis. In this article, we explored and compared the use of random search, simulating annealing, and Tree-of-Parzen-estimators algorithms of hyperparameter tuning to find the best architecture of a convolutional neural network to classify small pulmonary nodules in benign or malignant with a diameter of 5 to 10¬†mm. Our best model used result was the model using the simulating annealing algorithm and yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95, the sensitivity of 82\%, the specificity of 94\%, and accuracy of 88\% using a balanced data set of nodules. Therefore, our model is capable of classifying early lung nodules, where the patients have bigger chances of survival.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
