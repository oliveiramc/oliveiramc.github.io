      abstract={We propose a framework for Bayesian Likelihood-Free Inference (LFI) based on Generalized Bayesian Inference using scoring rules (SR). SR are used to evaluate probabilistic models given an observation; a proper SR is minimised in expectation when the model corresponds to the true data generating process for the observation. Using a strictly proper SR, for which the above minimum is unique, ensures posterior consistency of our method. As the likelihood function is intractable for LFI, we employ consistent estimators of SR using model simulations in a pseudo-marginal MCMC; we show the target of such chain converges to the exact SR posterior with increasing number of simulations. Furthermore, we note popular LFI techniques like Bayesian Synthetic Likelihood (BSL) and semiparametric BSL can be seen as special cases of our framework using only proper (but not strictly so) SR. We provide empirical results validating our consistency result and show how related approaches do not enjoy this property. Practically, we use the Energy and Kernel Scores, but our general framework sets the stage for extensions with other scoring rules. },

abstract={Lung cancer is the most lethal malignant neoplasm worldwide, with an annual estimated rate of 1.8 million deaths. Computed tomography has been widely used to diagnose and detect lung cancer, but its diagnosis remains an intricate and challenging work, even for experienced radiologists. Computer-aided diagnosis tools and radiomics tools have provided support to the radiologist's decision, acting as a second opinion. The main focus of these tools has been to analyze the intranodular zone; nevertheless, recent works indicate that the interaction between the nodule and its surroundings (perinodular zone) could be relevant to the diagnosis process. However, only a few works have investigated the importance of specific attributes of the perinodular zone and have shown how important they are in the classification of lung nodules. In this context, the purpose of this work is to evaluate the impact of using the perinodular zone on the characterization of lung lesions. Motivated by reproducible research, we used a large public dataset of solid lung nodule images and extracted fine-tuned radiomic attributes from the perinodular and intranodular zones. Our best-evaluated model obtained an average AUC of 0.916, an accuracy of 84.26{\%}, a sensitivity of 84.45{\%}, and specificity of 83.84{\%}. The combination of attributes from the perinodular and intranodular zones in the image characterization resulted in an improvement in all the metrics analyzed when compared to intranodular-only characterization. Therefore, our results highlighted the importance of using the perinodular zone in the solid pulmonary nodules classification process.},
