abstract={Lung cancer is the most lethal malignant neoplasm worldwide, with an annual estimated rate of 1.8 million deaths. Computed tomography has been widely used to diagnose and detect lung cancer, but its diagnosis remains an intricate and challenging work, even for experienced radiologists. Computer-aided diagnosis tools and radiomics tools have provided support to the radiologist's decision, acting as a second opinion. The main focus of these tools has been to analyze the intranodular zone; nevertheless, recent works indicate that the interaction between the nodule and its surroundings (perinodular zone) could be relevant to the diagnosis process. However, only a few works have investigated the importance of specific attributes of the perinodular zone and have shown how important they are in the classification of lung nodules. In this context, the purpose of this work is to evaluate the impact of using the perinodular zone on the characterization of lung lesions. Motivated by reproducible research, we used a large public dataset of solid lung nodule images and extracted fine-tuned radiomic attributes from the perinodular and intranodular zones. Our best-evaluated model obtained an average AUC of 0.916, an accuracy of 84.26{\%}, a sensitivity of 84.45{\%}, and specificity of 83.84{\%}. The combination of attributes from the perinodular and intranodular zones in the image characterization resulted in an improvement in all the metrics analyzed when compared to intranodular-only characterization. Therefore, our results highlighted the importance of using the perinodular zone in the solid pulmonary nodules classification process.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
